    <p id="para">Mangal Pandey is remembered as one of the first warriors to rise up
        against British colonial rule in India. He was a soldier in the British East India
        Company's army, serving in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry at Barrackpore, West Bengal.</p>
    <h3><u>Key Incident: The Rebellion of 1857</u></h3>
    <p id="key">On <strong>29, 1857</strong> , Mangal Pandey took a bold stand against British oppression,
        an incident that played a crucial role in the First War of Indian Independence:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <p id="1"><strong>The Enfield Rifle Controversy</strong>:The British East India Company introduced the
                Enfield rifle, which required soldiers to bite off the ends of newly issued cartridges.
                It was rumored that the cartridges were greased with animal fat—cow fat (which offended Hindus) and pig
                fat (which offended Muslims), leading to religious outrage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="2"><strong>Pandey’s Defiance</strong>: Mangal Pandey, deeply upset by the perceived religious insult,
                refused to use the cartridges. On March 29, he attacked Lieutenant Baugh,
                a British officer, with his musket, severely wounding him.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Confortation and Capture</strong>:During the incident on March 29, 1857, Mangal Pandey also tried to
            rally other soldiers of his regiment to join him.<br> However, the British forces managed to suppress the
            rebellion at Barrackpore. Pandey was overpowered and captured after a scuffle.</li>

        <li><strong>Trial and Execution</strong>Trial and Execution: Following a swift trial, Mangal Pandey was found
            guilty of mutiny. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on April 8, 1857, at Barrackpore. His
            execution was intended to serve as a warning to others, but it further inflamed discontent among Indian
            soldiers.</li>
